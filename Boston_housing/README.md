# 🏠 Boston House Price Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Housing price prediction is an important real-world problem in the real estate industry. 
This project focuses on analyzing the Boston Housing dataset to understand the factors that influence house prices.

By studying different features such as number of rooms, crime rate, and location-related variables, we can identify patterns that affect property value.

## 🎯 Objective
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analyze relationships between features and house prices  
- Identify key factors influencing property value  
- Build a regression model to predict house prices  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains housing-related information such as:

- CRIM (Crime Rate)  
- RM (Average Number of Rooms)  
- LSTAT (Lower Status Population %)  
- NOX (Nitric Oxide Concentration)  
- PTRATIO (Pupil-Teacher Ratio)  
- MEDV (Median House Price - Target Variable)  

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis
Key findings from the analysis:

- Houses with more rooms generally have higher prices.  
- Higher crime rates are associated with lower house prices.  
- Areas with higher LSTAT percentage tend to have lower property values.  
- Certain environmental and locality factors impact pricing significantly.  

---

## 📈 Results
The regression model successfully predicts housing prices based on key influencing features, demonstrating the relationship between property characteristics and market value.

---

## 💼 Business Insights
- Increasing property features such as room count can significantly impact pricing.  
- Crime rate reduction may increase property value in specific areas.  
- Socio-economic factors strongly influence real estate pricing trends.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib   
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis and regression modeling can be used to understand and predict housing prices using real-world data.
